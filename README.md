# Overview
Here all the necessary functions are stored (in the R programming language) to perform the measurements of the Molecular dYsregulated  PROfiles for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus patients (MyPROSLE), in which it is estimated how affected a series of molecular pathways are in a patient individually with respect to a distribution of healthy controls.

# Requirements
You will get file structure of the project and main scripts by using:

```
git clone https://github.com/GENyO-BioInformatics/MyPROSLE.git
```

or open it with GitHub Desktop (download it [here](https://desktop.github.com/)).

Also, you need to have ```R``` installed. You will find how to do it in the R project web (https://www.r-project.org/).


# How to use it

MyPROSLE estimates how affected are a serie of molecular pathways in a patient with respect to a distributions of healthy controls. The steps needed are located at [Script](/Script).
